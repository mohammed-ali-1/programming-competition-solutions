//  This program finds if a number is calm or not.
//  A calm number is a number in which every pair of adjacent digits differ by at most 1.
//  For example, 54 is a calm number because the difference between 5 and 4 is 1.
//  While 13 is not a calm number becuase the difference between 1 nad 3 is 2, which is bigger than 1.
